## Test Case
### Test Case 1
Objective: Verify that the tool correctly identifies a complete agreement.
Input:

Method 1: File Upload
Upload a PDF or DOCX file containing all six key clauses:

Scope of Authorization: Clearly defined.
Authorization Duration: Start and end dates specified.
Usage Restrictions: Explicitly stated.
Payment Terms: Detailed fees and payment schedule.
IP Ownership: Properly assigned.
Termination Terms: Clear and specific.
Method 2: Plain Text Input
Paste the entire content of the complete agreement into the plain text input field.

Expected Output:

All clauses are marked "Yes" with appropriate explanations.
Overall Assessment: "The agreement is complete."

### Test Case2:
Objective: Test the toolâ€™s ability to handle agreements with missing or unclear clauses.
Input:

Method 1: File Upload
Upload a PDF or DOCX file missing the following clauses:

Usage Restrictions
Termination Terms
Method 2: Plain Text Input
Paste agreement content missing the "Usage Restrictions" and "Termination Terms" clauses into the plain text input field.

Expected Output:

"Usage Restrictions" and "Termination Terms" are marked "No," with explanations indicating their absence.
Overall Assessment: "The agreement is incomplete."

### Test Case3:
Objective: Verify that the tool correctly handles partially completed agreements with some vague clauses.
Input:

Method 1: File Upload
Upload a PDF or DOCX file where some clauses are vague, such as:

Scope of Authorization: Defined, but lacks specific limitations.
Payment Terms: Mentioned, but details (e.g., amounts, schedules) are missing.
Method 2: Plain Text Input
Paste agreement content into the plain text field where:

"Scope of Authorization" clause does not include usage limits.
"Payment Terms" are referenced without specific amounts.

Expected Output:

"Scope of Authorization" is marked "No", with an explanation: "The scope lacks specific limitations."
"Payment Terms" is marked "No", with an explanation: "Payment details are missing."
Other well-defined clauses are marked "Yes" with appropriate explanations.
Overall Assessment: "The agreement is incomplete."
